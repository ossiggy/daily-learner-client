##About

Daily Learner was created to give its users a place to store lessons they learn every day.  We've broken the lessons down into 5 basic categories. This way, you can see where most of your lessons are coming from.  Just write down your lesson, choose a category, and submit.  The lessons go with you wherever you do.
